about=This plugin has been developed by Sandro Moretti for Deda Next (https://www.dedanext.it/) within the AIR-BREAK project (https://airbreakferrara.net/) and then further evolved into the current version with the financial support of BRGM (https://www.brgm.fr/en). The plugin leverages on QGIS SensorThings data provider to access SensorThingsAPI endpoints (https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings), visualize on map the position of their spatially-enabled entities (Locations, Multi/Datastreams and FeatureOfInterest) and inspect the related timeseries of Observations.
